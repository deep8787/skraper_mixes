# skraper_mixes

Additional XML mix files to use with Skraper (www.skraper.net) when scraping games on your EmulationStation or other supported front-end. 

This is just something I whipped up in my spare time, nothing too fancy. Im not a pro or anything so yeah they are not perfect. My screen is set up as 720p. Each folder has an example file if you want a preview.


If you have videos downloaded too, edit your theme.xml with the following to allow the video to be played correctly on the screen:


	<origin>0 .5</origin>
	<pos>0.202 0.422</pos>
	<maxSize>0.788 0.425</maxSize>
	<delay>0.5</delay>
	<showSnapshotNoVideo>false</showSnapshotNoVideo>
	<showSnapshotDelay>false</showSnapshotDelay>
	<zIndex>80</zIndex>


You may need to alter the zIndex depending on your curren theme and obviously delay can be changed to anything else (I would not decrease the time, 0.5 is perfect for when youre flicking through games)
