# skraper_mixes

Additional XML mix files to use with Skraper (www.skraper.net) when scraping games on your EmulationStation or other supported front-end. 

This is just something I whipped up in my spare time, nothing too fancy. Im not a pro or anything so yeah they are not perfect. My screen is set up as 720p. Each folder has an example file if you want a preview.
